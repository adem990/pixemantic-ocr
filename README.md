# 🔒 Pixemantic Internship Project — OCR & Biometric Verification System

**Status:** Confidential (No Source Code Shared)  
**Intern:** Adem — Summer Internship 2025  
**Organization:** Pixemantic  
**Period:** July – September 2025

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was completed during my summer internship at **Pixemantic**.  
It focuses on developing an **OCR-based data extraction and facial verification system** for **Tunisian ID cards**.

The main goal was to automatically:
- Extract structured text fields (name, CIN, date of birth, etc.)
- Verify the person’s identity using **face recognition**
- Provide a reliable and fast API to support ID validation
